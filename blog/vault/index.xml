But what’s better then rotated static secrets? Right, dynamic access! And that’s were Vault from HashiCorp comes in.
What is Vault? Vault is a cloud native secret management solution from HashiCorp. It tightly controls access to secrets and encryption keys by authenticating against trusted sources of identity such as Active Directory, LDAP, Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, and cloud platforms. Vault enables fine grained authorization of which users and applications are permitted access to secrets and keys.</description></item></channel></rss>
